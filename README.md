## Stop all locked multi-orders
Stop all MultiOrders that are locked. No new Runner shold be assigned / no MultiOrder started.

```
UPDATE "multi_order" 
SET "state" = 'failed'
WHERE "state" = 'locked';
```

Then put them back (**ONLY if there were no other `failed` when running previous script**):

```
UPDATE "multi_order" 
SET "state" = 'locked'
WHERE "state" = 'failed';
```

## Remove failed multiorders and retry
Removes all failed multiorders and mark all connected orders as new to forece core to retry

# Matrix Table

## Matrix Table does not store to slot

### Find PickerCommand in sector
```
SELECT * 
FROM "picker_command" AS pc, "sub_multi_order" AS smo
WHERE "sector_id" = <SECTOR_ID> AND pc.sub_multi_order_id = smo.id
```

### Did we send PickerComand?
- TODO:
 
### Did EMANS accept PickerCommand
- TODO:

### Did EMANS confirmed picking finished?
- TODO:

## Matrix Table does no flush slot
- Is there a goods stored in a slot?
- Is there a Runner under a slot? Did fleet notified runner has arrived?
- Did we send the flush request to Table?
- Did Table confirm the flush request?
- Did Table end us flush finished notification?
- TODO:

# Fleet

## Fleet does not continue after flush
- Did Table notify Core that flushing was finished?
- Did we send Fleet continue request?
- Did Fleet accept continue request?
- Did Fleet send notification Runner has arrived to the station?
- Is the target station for the Runner free? Isn't there deadlock - cyclical dependency?

## Fleet does not continue after packing
### Did EMANS notify Core that packing was finished?

### Did we send Fleet continue request?
- Did Fleet accept continue request?
- Did Fleet send notification Runner has arrived to the station?
- Is the target station for the Runner free? Isn't there deadlock - cyclical dependency?

Solutions:
- Change state of runner from PICKING -> PICKING_DONE

## Positions and open-times for Fleet Command

```
SELECT fcs.id, position_id, state, fleet_continue_request_id, fleet_position_id
FROM "fleet_command_station" AS fcs, "position" AS p
WHERE "fleet_command_id" = '523' AND fcs.position_id = p.id
LIMIT 50
```

# Packing
## Does Core know Runner has arrived to packing?
## Did we send `packing_request` to EMANS?
- Check if ExternalCommand with type `pack` and multiorder_id exists 
- Resolve:
- set multi_order back to in_progress
- set fleet_command back to in_progress
- set last packing `fleet_command_station` from `arrived` back to `planned`
- restart application

## Did EMANS accept `packing_request`?
- Did EMANS send us packing finished notification?

- Did we send command to Fleet?
- Did Fleet acknowledged the command?
- Did Fleet confirmed

# Locking

## EMANS has MultiOrder locked, but we do not have command accepted
They respond with HTTP 403 to out repeated requests.

**Solution:** Set state of `external_command = accepted` and restart.

## EMANS did not accept packing request for a long time, so that it stopped to retry

**Solution:** 
In `rc-2`: Set state of `external_command = request_failed_to_send` and wait few seconds for periodic checker.
In future (`main`): Such error will be resend every 30s (config)

# Special Queries

## Find Order, that adds the most (maximizes) average quantity per stop to already chosen Orders
```
SELECT "o"."id" AS oid, AVG(quantity) AS avg
FROM sub_order AS s, "order" AS o
WHERE "s"."order_id" <= 2000 OR "s"."order_id" = "o"."id"
GROUP BY o.id
ORDER BY avg DESC
```

## Find Orders with minimal number of sectors
```
SELECT order_id, count(sub_order.sector_id) AS sector_count 
FROM "order"
JOIN "sub_order" ON "sub_order"."order_id" = "order"."id"
WHERE "order".state = 'new'
